This code knows to recognize two types of input after being trained.
The input takes two numbers, first the radius of a circle or the length of a square's side.
The second one is the area.

Pi is assumed to be '3.14'.

Examples:
1 3.14
(above represents a circle with radius = 1 and area = 3.14)

2 4
(above represents a square with side=2 and area = 4)

The application will ask for a label for each of the above test cases.
One can provide any one line text.
It will later be able to identify any input matching that label.
Input 'halt' to exit.

For example:

Alpa started - waiting for input (for example 'radius area')
